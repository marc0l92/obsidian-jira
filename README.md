## Installation
From the obsidian app go in `Settings > Third-party plugins > Community Plugins > Browse` and search for `jira-issue`.

## Configuration

Use the plugin options to configure the connection to your company Atlassian Jira server: host, username and password.

There are three authentication methods:

- Open: used for server without authentication.
- [Basic](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617): username and password are used to login in your server.
  - Note for Jira Cloud instances this will be your email address and an API token. API tokens can be generated in Jira Cloud from `Account Settings > Security > Create and manage API tokens`
- [Bearer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750): a token is used to login in your server.

This plugin stores your credentials in clear in the configuration file of this plugin.

## Markdown Syntax

### ðŸ“ƒ`jira-issue`
Use the `jira-issue` fence to track issues:

    ```jira-issue
    AAA-111
    AAA-222
    https://my.jira-server.com/browse/BBB-333
    # This is a comment
    ```

### ðŸ”Ž`jira-search`
Use the `jira-search` fence to perform JQL queries:

    ```jira-search
    resolution = Unresolved AND assignee = currentUser() AND status = 'In Progress' order by priority DESC
    ```

You can customize the output in the settings or directly in the fence using the following keywords:

| Keyword | Description | Default | Values |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| `type` | Rendering mode of the search results | `TABLE` | `TABLE` or `LIST` |
| `query` | Query to use with Jira to retrieve the results |  |  |
| `limit` | Maximum number of items to display | Use value from settings | Integer number |
| `columns` | List of columns to render ([Available columns](#available-columns)) | Use value from settings | Comma separated list |

Example:

    ```jira-search
    type: TABLE
    query: status = 'In Progress' order by priority DESC
    limit: 15
    columns: KEY, SUMMARY, -ASSIGNEE, -REPORTER, STATUS
    ```

### ðŸ”¢`jira-count`
Use the `jira-count` fence to perform JQL queries and display the number of results:

    ```jira-count
    project = REF AND status changed to (Done, "Won't Fix", Archived, "Can't Reproduce", "PM Validated") after -14d
    ```

## Available Columns

Available columns extracted from the Jira issue:

    KEY, SUMMARY, TYPE, CREATED, UPDATED, REPORTER, ASSIGNEE, PRIORITY, STATUS, DUE_DATE,
    RESOLUTION, RESOLUTION_DATE, PROJECT, ENVIRONMENT, LABELS, FIX_VERSIONS, COMPONENTS,
    AGGREGATE_TIME_ESTIMATE, AGGREGATE_TIME_ORIGINAL_ESTIMATE, AGGREGATE_TIME_SPENT,
    TIME_ESTIMATE, TIME_ORIGINAL_ESTIMATE, TIME_SPENT, AGGREGATE_PROGRESS, PROGRESS, LAST_VIEWED

- Columns names are case insensitive.
- If the column starts with `-`, the compact mode is used.

Example:

    ```jira-search
    query: key = OPEN-357
    columns: key, -key, type, -type, reporter, -reporter, created, -created
    ```
![Compact Columns](./doc/compactColumns.png)

JIRA non standard column (custom fields) can be inserted using the `$` symbol.

Example:
    ```jira-search
    query: key = OPEN-357
    columns: key, summary, $12313422, $12313426, -$12313499, $Epic Link, $Global Rank
    ```

It is possible to provide the ID number of the custom field or its name.

## Link notes to `jira-search` table

The special column `NOTES` can be used with `jira-search` tables to create a column that shows all the notes that start with the issue key.

Example:

    ```jira-search
    query: key = OPEN-357
    columns: key, summary, status, notes
    ```

![Notes Column](./doc/notesColumn.png)

You can also access the frontmatter section of the note using the [jsonpath](https://github.com/dchester/jsonpath) syntax after the column `NOTES`. Example:

```jira-search
query: key = OPEN-357
columns: key, notes, notes.title, notes.status, notes.tags, notes.tags[0], notes..book[?(@.price<30 && @.category=="fiction")]
```


## Inline issues
This plugin allows you to detect inline issue and render them inside your text without creating a dedicated fence block.
In the settings it is possible to configure the prefix used to identify inline issues and if you want to render url to issues.

Example:

    With inline issue you can insert an issue like JIRA:OPEN-351 inside your text.
    The plugin will detect urls like https://jira.secondlife.com/browse/OPEN-352 and render the issue as tags.
    - [ ] Issue can be extended JIRA:OPEN-353 with the summary
    - [x] Or compact JIRA:-OPEN-354 without the summary
    - [ ] JIRA:-OPEN-355 use the `-` symbol before the issue key to make it compact
    ```
    The plugin searches inside the note for those patterns and replace them
    JIRA:-OPEN-356
    ```
